Touch Screen Version of the Light Wand
This was originally based on http://mrossphoto.com/digital-light-wand/
I found the 2 line display boring, so I rewrote the whole thing to use a touch screen.
While I was at it I speeded the SD reading and led writing up to much more reasonable speeds.
I added some internal display examples for fun.
I am still working on some of the 3D parts for the wand. I'll publish them here when I'm done.
I added folder support on the SD for better organizing.
You can also chain files together.
There are setup files that can be attached to folders or individual files.
I welcome any ideas.
